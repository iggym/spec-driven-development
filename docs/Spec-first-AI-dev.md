Specification-first AI development is a methodical approach that prioritizes comprehensive documentation of system requirements, performance expectations, and compliance needs before any code for an AI system is written. This approach offers several key benefits:

1.  **Enhanced Stakeholder Alignment:** Specifications foster a shared understanding, or "AI fluency," between technical and business teams. This eliminates ambiguity regarding project goals and criteria for success.
2.  **Earlier Problem Detection:** Identifying inconsistencies and potential issues during the specification phase significantly reduces the resources needed compared to discovering these problems later in development or deployment.
3.  **Reduced Development Cycles:** By establishing precise expectations before development begins, clear specifications minimize rework and lead to shorter iteration cycles. This means engineers spend less time making assumptions about stakeholder needs and more time building to defined standards.
