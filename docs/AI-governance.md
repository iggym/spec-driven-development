**AI governance** is defined as a framework comprising rules, practices, and policies that guide how an organization manages its Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. The primary purpose of AI governance is to ensure that the AI utilized by a business aligns with its goals, complies with relevant regulations, and operates ethically.

This framework emphasizes building, following, and documenting processes to ensure AI technology adheres to company values, customer expectations, and evolving legal standards.

The five key principles to consider when establishing an AI governance structure are:

*   **Transparency**: Ensuring that decisions made by AI are explainable and understandable.
*   **Fairness**: Actively working to prevent unintentional biases within AI systems that could lead to discriminatory outcomes.
*   **Accountability**: Designating human responsibility for the outcomes produced by AI systems.
*   **Privacy and Security**: Protecting user data and strictly adhering to federal and state data protection laws.
*   **Document**: Meticulously documenting every step throughout the AI governance process, as "if it's not in writing, it didn't happen".
