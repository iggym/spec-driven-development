Here scaffolding that turns this vision into a repeatable, LLM-powered system. 
Below is a comprehensive framework for chatbot-driven Spec Kit workflows, organized into **pipelines, contexts, steps, and prompt guidelines** for each of the four phases: **Specify → Plan → Tasks → 

# 🧠 Spec Kit Chatbot Workflow Framework

## 🧭 Overview

| Phase       | Purpose                                      | Artifact(s) Produced                          |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Specify     | Define intent and scope                      | Spec document, discovery prompts              |
| Plan        | Translate intent into architecture & strategy| Implementation plan, decision log             |
| Tasks       | Break down plan into actionable units        | Task list, checklist, dependencies            |
| Implement   | Generate and validate code                   | Code artifacts, test coverage, verification   |

Each phase is powered by **LLM pipelines** that use structured prompts, context-aware workflows, and validation steps to ensure quality and alignment.

## 🔍 Phase 1: Specify

### 🎯 Goal: Capture clear, complete intent

### 🧩 Context Inputs:
- Project goal or feature idea
- User personas
- Constraints (security, compliance, performance)

### 🛠️ LLM Pipeline Steps:
1. **Intent Clarification**
   - _Prompt:_ “What problem are we solving, and who is affected?”
2. **Scope Definition**
   - _Prompt:_ “List what’s in scope and what’s explicitly out.”
3. **Requirement Extraction**
   - _Prompt:_ “Convert the goals into functional requirements.”
4. **Spec Drafting**
   - _Prompt:_ “Generate a spec document using our template.”

### ✅ Validation Prompts:
- “Does this spec include measurable success criteria?”
- “Are there any ambiguous or speculative features?”

---

## 🧱 Phase 2: Plan

### 🎯 Goal: Design a strategy to fulfill the spec

### 🧩 Context Inputs:
- Approved spec
- Existing architecture (if any)
- Team capabilities

### 🛠️ LLM Pipeline Steps:
1. **Architecture Mapping**
   - _Prompt:_ “Suggest a high-level architecture based on this spec.”
2. **Decision Logging**
   - _Prompt:_ “Document trade-offs and rationale for key decisions.”
3. **Implementation Strategy**
   - _Prompt:_ “Break down the spec into modules or components.”

### ✅ Validation Prompts:
- “Does the plan align with the spec’s constraints?”
- “Are all decisions traceable to spec elements?”

---

## 📋 Phase 3: Tasks

### 🎯 Goal: Translate plan into actionable units

### 🧩 Context Inputs:
- Implementation plan
- Team roles and timelines

### 🛠️ LLM Pipeline Steps:
1. **Task Generation**
   - _Prompt:_ “Create a task list from this implementation plan.”
2. **Dependency Mapping**
   - _Prompt:_ “Identify task dependencies and sequencing.”
3. **Checklist Creation**
   - _Prompt:_ “Generate a checklist for each task to ensure completeness.”

### ✅ Validation Prompts:
- “Are all tasks traceable to plan components?”
- “Are any tasks missing acceptance criteria?”

---

## 💻 Phase 4: Implement

### 🎯 Goal: Generate, test, and verify code

### 🧩 Context Inputs:
- Task list
- Approved plan
- Coding standards

### 🛠️ LLM Pipeline Steps:
1. **Code Generation**
   - _Prompt:_ “Generate code for this task using the spec and plan.”
2. **Test Creation**
   - _Prompt:_ “Write unit tests based on the spec’s success criteria.”
3. **Verification**
   - _Prompt:_ “Validate that the code meets the spec and passes all tests.”

### ✅ Validation Prompts:
- “Does the implementation match the spec’s intent?”
- “Are all compliance and security requirements met?”

---

## 🧠 Meta-Guidelines for Prompt Design

- **Always anchor prompts in the spec**: Intent is the source of truth.
- **Use role-based framing**: “As a security reviewer…” or “As a product owner…”
- **Include validation loops**: Ask the LLM to critique its own output.
- **Favor modularity**: Break prompts into atomic steps to reduce hallucination.
- **Bake in constraints**: Security, compliance, performance should be first-class citizens.

---

## 🚀 Applications

- **New Projects**: Use full pipeline from Specify to Implement.
- **Feature Additions**: Start at Specify with delta specs.
- **Legacy Modernization**: Begin with reverse-specification, then replan and retask.
